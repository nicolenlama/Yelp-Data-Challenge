Yelp DataSet Challenge

1. New Happy Hour/Specials Category 
2. New HotSpots?
	What are the attrs that 
	people care about the most
	when choosing a restaurant?
	Does a new restaurant have
	these attrs? When a new
	restaurant incorporates these
	attrs, is it more successful?
	More check ins?
3. Going off of 2 still, maybe there is a
way to target trendsetting users. Based on
"hip" slang, photos, frequency of reviews,
avoidance of chains, locations?, number
of friends, number of compliments?
